# Titanium Web Dialog

Use the SFSafariViewController (iOS) and Chrome Pages (Android) together. Currently in development and scheduled 
as a pre-packaged module for Titanium SDK 7.1.0 and later.

## Roadmap

- [x] Find suitable module name
- [x] Create both modules on the same namespace (right now [Ti.SafariDialog](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.safaridialog) vs [Ti.ChromeTabs](https://github.com/prashantsaini1/ti-chrometabs))
- [ ] Adjust existing docs from Ti.SafariDialog to support Android as well
- [x] Write cross-platform example and tests
- [ ] Pre-package in the SDK, release module
